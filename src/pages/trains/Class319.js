                    <h1>British Rail Class 319 EMU</h1>
                    These are some of my favourite commuter trains, built in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They have epic motors which can thrash like mad, producing an awesome whine at low speeds which morphs into a roar at high speeds. They were originally built with dual voltage capability, able to operate off third rail and overhead electric lines. This was important because they were the first trains to operate the Thameslink service running trains from Bedford (where there are overhead electric power lines) to Brighton (where third rail prevails) - they swapped power source upon stopping at Farringdon or City Thameslink station in London. This same service is now operated by Class 700 'Stormtroopers', meaning that quite a few of them have been displaced to operate newly electrified railways in the North of England (Northern Electrics) or the St. Albans Abbey branch of the WCML. More recently, some of them are being converted to 'flex' units via the addition of diesel engines to allow them to run on non-electrified track. This is incredible, as this means that the GWR variant of the flex units will be tri-mode; able to run on three different power sources.
