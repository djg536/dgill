                Known locally as simply 'The Metro', the Tyne and Wear Metro is the second most heavily used of the metro systems in the UK, serving Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, South Shields and more. It was formed in 1980, the result of a construction project to build new tunnels under Newcastle and Gateshead linking to modernised Victorian surface railways. Unlike many metro systems, the trains are powered via overhead electrification.
